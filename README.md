# credit-risk-classification

This project can be split into three parts: 
    - Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
    - Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
    - Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
1. Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns. (value of 1 = high risk of defaulting)
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using `train_test_split`.
   
### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
1. Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).
2. Save the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance by doing the following:
4. Generate a confusion matrix.
5. 
### Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
